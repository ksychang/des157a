    SOME IDEAS:
    * Change background color on hover over 'space', 'time', or 'being'
    * Image trail when cursor moves within those sections
    * On click, hide sections
    * Narrative - only reveal next section after first was explored. All available after 'being'
    
    * Space:
        * Letters expand on hover over header (return home on click)
        * Letters get pushed by cursor
        * Image carousel, pause on hover + caption on click
        * Background color = blues
    
    * Time:
        * Letters slightly expand and disappear on hover over header (return home on click)
        * Images arranged in a row, trigger fade out + caption fade in on hover (caption fades out)
        * OR fade to sepia filter
        * Background color = greens
    
    * Being:
        * Letters 'breathe' on hover (return home on click)
        * Centered image, show drag cursor on hover
        * As image is dragged in different areas on the screen, change image
        * Background color = reds
