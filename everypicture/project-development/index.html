            My concept for the Every Picture Project is called <em>Spaces of Transition</em>. My collection of images
            includes places where we experience transitions in life, space, time, feelings, relationships, and more.
            <br><br>

            After completing my interaction experiments, I realized I want to continue incorporating interactions on my
            page that represent or emphasize transitions depicted in the photos. I have brainstormed some ideas for
            different sections throughough my page that the user can walk through, and potential interactions I may
            create for each of them.<br><br>

            To record my ideas, I created the mind map shown on the left. I plan to draw some of my inspiration for the
            visual design system from other meditation or prayer apps. I will also conduct further experiments on
            interactions as I nail down the flow of the narrative. My main goal for this project is to practice
            taking users on a journey and creating a reflective, meaningful digital experience.
