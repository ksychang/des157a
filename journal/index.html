                        Form design is a critical yet often overlooked area of UI/UX that can play a major role in the
                        conversion rate of a website or application. Filling out a form can be a dreary and sometimes
                        impossible task, but with good design choices we can make it a more streamlined and even
                        enjoyable
                        experience.
                    </p>

                        <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">This article</a>
                        outlines
                        some great best practices for form design to implement. One tip I found really interesting was
                        to
                        not make labels inline, but above or to the left of the field. This is because when the user
                        enters
                        input, the label disappears and the user might forget what they were entering into the field. I
                        have
                        never put
                        much thought into the positioning of field labels, so reading about where they should be placed
                        made
                        me much more aware of the subtlety of these practices. My takeaway from the 20 tips given in the
                        article was that our main goal should be to minimize any potential annoyances or pain points the
                        user might encounter so their focus can remain on their original task.

                        One website I recently used that I think implements these form design practices well is <a
                            href="https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/checkout/shipping-address">Urban Outfitters</a>. They
                        follow all the best practices for labeling, layout, error messages, indicating required fields,
                        and
                        displaying the multiple steps needed via a progress bar.

                        Modals are a UI pattern that were created to address the issue of limited screen space. When we
                        want the user’s attention or input, or to show them additional information that may or may not
                        be related to the main content, modal windows can sometimes be used as an effective solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, given some of the problems surrounding modals, there are several considerations that
                        should be made before using them. They can interrupt user flow, especially when they are not
                        triggered by a user action. Poor implementation of modals have also trained users to
                        automatically close them, which can defeat their original purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some best practices with using modals, if they are deemed the most appropriate solution, are to
                        ensure they have good anatomy and accessibility. A well designed modal will have an intuitive
                        way to close it, descriptive title, clear purpose or corresponding action, and proper placement
                        in the window.
                    </p>

                            href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">this
                            article</a> reminded me how important it is to take UX into consideration when
                        designing UI. As someone who loves to focus on the visuals and perfecting little details, it is
                        humbling to know that if a user has been trained to ignore the component I am designing, my work
                        will be useless. In my career, I want to make sure that I am open to solutions beyond what is
                        traditionally used in order to create the most effective designs possible.

                        I’ve always viewed visual thinking as a kind of competition with myself, where I challenge my
                        synthesizing skills and ask, “<em>How can I see beyond what’s here at face value?</em>”
                        Unfortunately,
                        I’m not sure that I’m the best at reading between the lines and interpreting the details I see
                        in images. However, I do think this is a skill I can develop over time, and I have seen some
                        improvements over time as I keep challenging myself to think more critically about images.
                        <br><br>
                        In terms of visual thinking, I find <a href="https://figurefilm.co.uk/about/
">this website</a> to have a really interesting interactive element with images. In the second section of the page, a
                        trail of images appears as you move the cursor around. Each image is different in size, shape,
                        and content. I think it encourages visual thinking because it makes the viewer consider how each
                        of those images relates to the story of the design collective. The collection of images as a
                        whole help provide a sense of who the brand is and what they’re all about. I think this element
                        could be a fun addition to my project if I can figure out how to implement it.

                        Saul’s images are about pathways, places where people travel or move through. This particular
                        image is an outdoor path. For me, I find it interesting that the path is completely empty at
                        what looks like midday. I also noticed there is a stop sign at the end of the path, and a wire
                        fence running along the sides.
                        <br><br>
                        My suggestions to Saul were that if he were to rephotograph this
                        image, he could consider taking it at different heights to indicate different perspectives, such
                        as someone taller or perhaps a dog being walked on the path. I said that a potential concept to
                        explore is the idea that even though we all walk along the same path, our experiences of the
                        journey can be vastly different.

                        This is one of my favorite images in my collection. I took it in the house I am currently living
                        in, when we were first moving in and the living room was still clean. The late afternoon
                        sunlight beams in through the blinds onto the floor. One of my housemates is by the window,
                        unpacking a box of her things sitting on the couch.
                        <br><br>
                        To me, this moment I captured represents transitions in time, space, and life. Moving into a new
                        house was an exciting but also scary transition, and not knowing how relationships and routines
                        would pan out was uncomfortable. In the same way the afternoon sun was transitioning to the
                        evening, the sun was beginning to set on my previous chapter in college, and I was moving onto a
                        new one.
                        <br><br>
                        To make this image more compelling, I might consider cropping it to focus more on my housemate
                        and the sunbeams on the floor. This would reduce the other details in the room, like the couch,
                        door, ceiling fan, shelves, and hanging jackets. For some of my other images I think this would
                        be beneficial, but for others they are better off with all the details contained in the photo.
